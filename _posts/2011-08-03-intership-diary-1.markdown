So now I have been told by my friends, university, and manager – I suppose its about time to start writing to some kind of journal – so I figured if I was going to idly bash keys, it might as well be immortalised online for all to see.

Its not through some romantic desire to write fluffy novels that the title of this post came about, more a sense of ultimate shock and awe that I have already been working at Microsoft for a month now, well a month tomorrow. I still feel like the brand new guy, all confused and heady – mind you what I havn’t realised is I am actually now making a positive impact on what I am supposed to be doing.

You might be wondering what it is we do, I am part of the Global Technical Support Centre, working as a Developer Support Engineer for Messaging Development. Ok, so its a mouthful, but in short it means I support Microsoft Customers who are developing software to work with any of our “messaging” applications – customer development issues with Outlook Add-Ins or Exchange EWS are good examples.

I like this job, as its a little of what I am used to from all my previous work & Uni, I spend a large amount of my day rummaging around in code and developing, I do customer service and satisfaction and there are more side projects going about than I care to think about, including some Windows Phone 7 Dev – not what I had expected, but definitely a decent position.

Getting used to the way things work here has been a little odd, for such a large entity the ethos is remarkably open, friendly and trusting, the hierarchy feels very flat and the whole experience leaves you looking forward to coming back to work the next day, it is almost the exact opposite of what I expected given the general concensus on large corporate life. This is where I think so much of the brilliance in the people, products and services from Microsoft is brewed, people feel supported and happy to give their all, and it shows, I had never thought you could fit so much knowlege in one buidling.

Suffice to say you can probably tell I like it here, So onward it is – Ones things for sure, I already know I will miss this place when I go back to Uni next year!
