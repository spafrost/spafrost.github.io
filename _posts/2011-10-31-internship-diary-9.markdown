So, you might ask – assuming anyone actually reads this , why on earth have you not blogged for nearly a month ?

I can put the first week down to laziness, feeling in need of a little relaxation – the second week was actually down to a sudden influx in difficult cases, and the last few weeks well….

As you may have noticed, my blog is sporting a new theme, unfortunately this has nothing to do with my need for an autumn change, or sudden moment of design consciousness – some delightful individual decided it would be a worthwhile activity to hack into my WordPress install and go script-kiddy on its behind. Thankfully a quick ticket with my amazing hosts TSOHost had my hosting package fully reset and a nice patched version loaded up in no time.

While this whole drama has been unfolding, I have been out with Microsoft at Universities in a giant inflatable cube, called the IFCube – as part of the Innovation Festival – and effort to enthuse and excite a new year of interns and graduates to come and take on placements with Microsoft! It was extremely rewarding to see students getting excited about doing what they love!

I suppose now my blog is alive again, I should probably get back to the usual Monday morning.
