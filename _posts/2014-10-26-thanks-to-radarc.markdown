Recently, I gained my foundation amateur radio licence with the help of the fantastic Reading & District Amateur Radio Club. Their course was practical and not too formal, with a great sense of what was required, and what was “required hoop jumping”.

There is broad membership, young to old and a good community feel – and certainly enough anecdotes to keep anyone busy.

I am looking forward to attending some meetings, and moving on to intermediate in the future, for now, I need to wait for Ofcom to update their database so I can claim a callsign!
