Welcome to my new website. 

I have made the choice to move my personal website over to GitHub pages, as running a WordPress instance and all of the spam, breach attempts and hosting management and costs didn't seem worth it for the 3 updates I made every year. 

I will try to move some of the old content over to ensure it is preserved, but I make no promises. 

Oh - and happy new year for 2025!
