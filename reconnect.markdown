In light of diminishing privacy, politicisation and proliferation of [dark patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern) I have recently removed my account(s) on many popular social media sites & services including Twitter, Whatsapp, Facebook and Messenger.

If I have sent you here, it means I don't want to lose touch - but I don't have a way to contact you outside of social media.

So here are ways you can contact me if you wish to. 

- You can contact me on Signal using my username skyshovel.16 - [Signal is a privacy focused messenger I suggest you try too!](https://signal.org/)
- I still have and use my UK mobile number ending ***17 for Voice & SMS
- Email my forename at this websites domain name.
- Connect with me on LinkedIn
