In light of diminishing privacy, politicisation and proliferation of [dark patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern) I have recently removed my account(s) on many popular social media sites & services including Twitter, Whatsapp, Facebook and Messenger.

If I have sent you here, it means I don't want to lose touch - but I don't have a way to contact you outside of social media.

So here are ways you can contact me if you wish to, 

### Using Signal Messenger

You can contact me on Signal using my username **skyshovel.16** . Signal is a privacy focused messenger [I suggest you try too!](https://signal.org/). It handles just like WhatsApp or other modern smartphone messaging apps but without the threat of your data being sold or handed over to third parties. 

### Old Fashioned Mobile Phone or SMS
 I still have and use my UK mobile number ending ***17 for Voice & SMS which I will happily share with you face/face if ou don't already know it. 

 ### Using Email
Email my forename at this websites domain name and we can connect that way if you prefer. 

### On LinkedIn
I still have an active LinkedIn profile you can use to message me. [https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonpafrost](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonpafrost/)

### Through GitHub ?!
If you can't think of any other way, raise an issue on my personal repo ? [https://github.com/spafrost/spafrost/issues](https://github.com/spafrost/spafrost/issues)
