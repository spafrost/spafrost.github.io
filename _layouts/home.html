<h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
<p>I’m Simon, a 30-something technologist, living on the edge of the North Cotswolds.</p>
<p>I work for Microsoft UK in Reading as a Senior Technical Consultant, helping my customers undertake transformative Modern Work projects.</p>
<p>I attended The Henley College where my studies gained me a scholarship to The University of Reading where I studied (and loved) Computer Science (BSc), graduating with a First Class Honours Degree in 2013. My dissertation was published as part of ICDVRAT 2014, Speech Development and Therapy Using the Kinect.</p>
<p>My life long passion is to take the world apart and see how it works – especially where I can put it back together better than it ever was.</p>
<p>I am not the most reliable of bloggers, but when I find something out I couldn’t solve on the web, I like to add it to my blog in the hope it will help someone else.</p>
<p>Welcome to my space, and feel free to reach out to me if you think there is something I can help with, work or personal.</p>
<p>If you want to get in touch since I deleted a social media account <a href="/recon">go here!</a></p>
